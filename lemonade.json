        "To serve, dilute with water â€“ 1 part cordial to 3 or 4 parts water. To make fizzy lemonade, dilute with sparkling mineral water or soda water. For a party, try pink lemonade by adding a few drops of pink food colouring to the cordial. Dress up the glasses with fancy straws, ice cubes, slices of fruit and cocktail umbrellas or little plastic toys."]
